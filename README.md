**Figure 1** - Gantt chart of whatâ€™s to be expected over the first year of my study. The start of the year represents a period of training (yellow bars) which leads to a period of data collection and writing up my findings (turquoise bars). My research will also be presented at conference (blue bars) published in a peer reviewed jouirnal (red bar) near the start of the second year.
