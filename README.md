**Figure 1** - Gantt chart of whatâ€™s to be expected over the first year of my study. The start of the year represents a period of training (yellow bars) which leads to a period of data collection and writing up my findings (turquoise bars). My research will also be presented at conference (blue bars) published in a peer reviewed jouirnal (red bar) near the start of the second year.

**Figure 2** - 2D continental extension model with a spreading rate of 0.25 cm/year at each boundary. Demonstrates how the upper crust, lower crust and mantle deform after 0, 20 and 40 Myr.

**Figure 3** - A 3D orthogonal extension model that facilitates the development of 2 spreading ridges joined by a transform. Panels show the surface material evolution and the total strain at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Myr.

**Figure 4** - A global velocity model that displays current day plate velocities. The Muller2019-Young2019-Cao2020_CombinedRotations.rot file was used to create this model.
