To load this dataset in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the file format you want to load
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the globe.

In order to reconstruct these features, you will need to load in the underlying rotation model (.rot file) which can be found in the Sample Data or downloaded from http://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-1-software-and-data-sets/.  

Play around with the GPlates buttons to make an animation, select features, draw features, etc.  For more information, read the GPlates manual which can be downloaded from www.gplates.org.
