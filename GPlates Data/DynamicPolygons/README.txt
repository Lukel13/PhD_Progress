This directory contains the Müller et al. (2019), Cao et al. (2020), and Young et al. (2018) topological plate polygon and plate boundary dataset. 

Note: Some minor topology artefacts are fixed in this version of the files that are compatible with GPlates 2.3 and newer and the topologies were updated after the Torsvik et al. (2019) Pacific rotations were implemented.

Directory contains one file:

- Muller2019-Young2019-Cao2020_PlateBoundaries.gpmlz

To load these datasets in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the file you want to load
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the globe.
                   
In order to reconstruct these features, you will need to load in the underlying rotation model (.rot file) which can be found in the Sample Data or downloaded from http://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-2-software-and-data-sets/.  

The topological plate polygon file is different to the standard data files released with GPlates.  This file includes both the plate polygons and the intersecting lines that make up the plate polygons.  When you load the gpmlz file into GPlates, the plate polygons and the intersecting lines will be displayed.  However, for the purpose of visualization, you may want to only display the plate polygon data.  To do this, go to the Layers toolbar on the right hand side of the screen.  Click on the eye next to green tab.  This will make all the lines that make up the plate polygons invisible, allowing only the plate polygons to be displayed.  To switch the lines back on, just click the eye again.

For more information on using topological data, see the GPlates tutorials.
